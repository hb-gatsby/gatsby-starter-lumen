## Overview

[Fleek.co](https://Fleek.co/) offers a seamless workflow. It offers all the tools needed to deploy and manage sites on IPFS. Focus on content and code. Fleek handles the rest.

## IPFS & Data Integrity

IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. It’s a distributed file system used for storing and sharing files, data and websites. The system has unique benefits such as decentralization and data integrity. More information [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/overview/).

IPFS is decentralized by creating a peer-to-peer network that can be hosted anywhere. It provides data integrity *by linking to its content* instead of location. For example:

<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u>

The QmWAT… is the hash of the content “Hello World”.

If someone were to change “Hello World” to “Goodbye World”, the hash **and thus** the link will change.

It’ll be impossible to change the content without changing the link, which is great for data integrity. But…

## What if the content changes?

If the content changes, the hash will change and the link will change.

This can be a headache if you‘re adding/updating content. Imagine a blog with new articles everyday. You’ll have to generate a new hash every time something changes.

Everything downstream will also be changed. If you have a domain name (myawesomeipfswebsiteblog.com), then you’ll have to update the[ values](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-host-a-website-on-ipfs-with-dns-82f1f2fe6361) to the new hash.

## Fleek

Fleek aims to simplify web development into one seamless workflow. Simply push changes to Git and Fleek will automatically update, pin and deploy changes downstream.

Some features:

* Fleek accommodates many frameworks such as gatsby, jekyll, create-react-app etc.
* Fleek also handles DNS records. Either purchase a domain from them or point it to a domain you purchased elsewhere.
* No need to manually update hashes, TXT values etc.
* Fleek provides a [CID](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/cid/)(content identifier) for more IPFS features such as verification and self hosting.
